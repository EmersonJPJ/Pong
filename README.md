# 🎮 Pong in C#

A modern and enhanced version of the classic Pong game, developed in C# using Windows Forms. This project showcases AI-driven gameplay, dynamic physics, and interactive sound effects.

## ✨ Features

- **Smart AI Opponent** 🤖: The CPU paddle improves as the player scores more points, increasing the challenge dynamically.
- **Realistic Ball Physics** ⚡: The ball gains speed with each collision, making the game progressively intense.
- **Dynamic Score Display** 🎨: The score blinks in different colors to provide visual feedback on each point scored.
- **Player & AI Modes** 🎭: Play solo against the AI or compete in a two-player mode.
- **Audio Feedback** 🔊: Collision sounds enhance the gaming experience, played using NAudio.
- **Mouse & Keyboard Controls** 🎮: Left paddle is controlled via mouse, right paddle by `W` and `S` (or AI-controlled).
- **Randomized Ball Direction** 🎲: Every new round starts with the ball moving in a random direction, ensuring unpredictable gameplay.
