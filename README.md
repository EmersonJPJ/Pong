# Pong in C#

A modern and enhanced version of the classic Pong game, developed in C# using Windows Forms. This project showcases AI-driven gameplay, dynamic physics, and interactive sound effects.

## Features

- **Smart AI Opponent**: The CPU paddle improves as the player scores more points, increasing the challenge dynamically.
- **Realistic Ball Physics**: The ball gains speed with each collision, making the game progressively intense.
- **Dynamic Score Display**: The score blinks in different colors to provide visual feedback on each point scored.
- **Player & AI Modes**: Play solo against the AI or compete in a two-player mode.
- **Audio Feedback**: Collision sounds enhance the gaming experience, played using NAudio.
- **Mouse & Keyboard Controls**: Left paddle is controlled via mouse, right paddle by `W` and `S` (or AI-controlled).
- **Randomized Ball Direction**: Every new round starts with the ball moving in a random direction, ensuring unpredictable gameplay.
